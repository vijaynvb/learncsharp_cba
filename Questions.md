 1. Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\"."

  expected output
     1
     2
     Fizz
     4
     Buzz
     Fizz
     7
     8
     Fizz
     Buzz
     11
     Fizz
     13
     14
     FizzBuzz
     16
     17

  2. Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum. If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'"
  Algorithm:
      step 1: accept 3 interger values 
      step 2: sum of 3 numbers 
      step 3: if sum <= 21 - return sum
      step 4: if sum > 21 and a[0],a[1],a[2] == 11 return sum - 10
      step 5: if sum > 21 return bust
